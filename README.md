# Express_Loadbalance

this is my sample load balancer using express and mysql.

Whats a load balancer you say?

a load balancer is more of a helpful middleware for distributing loads.

ever heard of CPU scheduling?

You might have heard of this somewhere like the First come first serve, and the shortest remaining time first,etc.

a load balancer helps to distribute incoming traffic among multiple servers running the application. 

therefore this thing optimizes the use of the servers and gives tons of points in performance.
